# Movie Ratings Hash Task
This app contains a script called `analyse_ratings.py`. This script provides functionality to analyse a movie ratings dataset, using a hash table.
To run the script, simply open up a terminal window (Mac) or command prompt (Windows) (make sure you download all the files in the folder, as it requires the other files in the folder to run properly),
navigate to the folder containing the script, and execute the script by running `./analyse_ratings.py`.

Then follow the instructions that appear on your screen.

In a nutshell, you can view the lowest rated movie, the highest rated movie, or view the average rating of a specific movie (It returns the first match for whatever movie title you enter, which may not always be the same if there are multiple matches).

## Dependencies
The script requires the python to be installed. In addition to this, it requires:
- Numpy (pip install numpy) [see more in this installationo guide https://numpy.org/install/]
- pandas (pip install pandas) [see more in this installation guide https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html]
